# z80ctc.h

Header-only emulator for the Z80 CTC (Counter/Timer Channels)
written in C.

Do this:
~~~C
#define CHIPS_IMPL
~~~
before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the 
implementation.

Optionally provide the following macros with your own implementation
~~~C
CHIPS_ASSERT(c)
~~~
    your own assert macro (default: assert(c))

!!! Note FIXME
    functions and usage documentation

!!! Note FIXME
    the spec says "After initialization, channels may be reprogrammed
    at any time. If updated control and time constant words are written
    to a channel during the count operation, the count continues to
    zero before the new time constant is loaded into the counter".
    The current implementation doesn't behave like this, instead it behaves
    like MAME. Needs more research!
