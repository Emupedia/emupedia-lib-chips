# z80pio.h

Header-only emulator for the Z80 PIO (Parallel Input/Output)
written in C.

Do this:
~~~C
#define CHIPS_IMPL
~~~
before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the 
implementation.

Optionally provide the following macros with your own implementation
~~~C
CHIPS_ASSERT(c)
~~~
    your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
