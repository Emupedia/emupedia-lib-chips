    # ui_memmap.h

    Generic home computer memory map visualization UI.

    Do this:
    ~~~C
    #define CHIPS_IMPL
    ~~~
    before you include this file in *one* C++ file to create the 
    implementation.

    Optionally provide the following macros with your own implementation
    
    ~~~C
    CHIPS_ASSERT(c)
    ~~~
        your own assert macro (default: assert(c))

    You need to include the following headers before including the
    *implementation*:

        - imgui.h

    All strings provided to ui_memmap_init() must remain alive until
    ui_memmap_discard() is called!
